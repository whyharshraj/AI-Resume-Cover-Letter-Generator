## AI-Resume-Cover-Letter-Generator
It’s a web application that helps users create professional resume summaries and cover letters using AI (GPT-2). Instead of writing everything yourself, you just fill in a few simple fields like your job title, experience, and skills — and the AI writes it for you.

##How it Works
User Inputs Information:
Job Title (e.g., Software Developer)
Experience (e.g., 2 years in backend development)
Skills (e.g., Python, Django, REST API)
Career Goals (e.g., grow into a full-stack developer role)

##AI Processes It:
A pre-trained AI model (GPT-2) reads this info.
It understands the context and generates a professional resume summary and cover letter.
User Gets Output:
The result is shown instantly in a clean, user-friendly interface built with Gradio.
